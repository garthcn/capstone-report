\section{Technical Terms}
\subsection{Native-side}
\begin{description}
	\item[User] \hfill \\
	Users need to signup on the native site to have full access to functionalities on Social Needle. When signing up, users can choose to link his/her native account with Facebook or Twitter. In this way, all the online activities will have the unified credential across all three platforms. 
	Users can follow each other to get updates of their activities. 
	\item[Post] \hfill \\
	All discussions on the native site will be organized into posts. A post has a title, its content, a set of tags and comments. Every user can create a post to initiate any discussion. A post on the native site corresponds to a ``tweet'' on Twitter and a ``status'' on Facebook Page. All content will be synchronized to Facebook and Twitter.
	\item[Tag] \hfill \\
	The author of a post can add one or more tags to the post when it is created. Users can follow tags and thus get updates on all content with the tags. 
	\item[Collection] \hfill \\
	Users can create collections to group posts into meaningful set. Unlike tags which belongs to a public tag pool, collections belong to individual users. Personal collections are visible to everyone, so user can follow others' collections and get updates of any posts in the collections. Users can create filter to import new posts with certain tags to their collections; or they can add posts to collections manually. 
	\item[News Feeds] \hfill \\
	News feeds is the list of posts on the homepage when user signs in. It is consisted of posts of followed users, followed tags and followed collections. 
\end{description}
\subsection{Facebook-side}
\begin{description}
	\item[Facebook] \hfill \\
	Facebook is one of the most popular SNSs on the Internet. As of January 2011, the number of active users on Facebook has reached 600 million\footnote{http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-has-more-than-600-million-users-goldman-tells-clients-2011-1}. On Facebook, users can create their own profiles and easily communicate with their friends. Facebook provides two ways for users to ``get together'' in cyberspace: Group and Page, both enabling users to come together online to share information and discuss specific topics. In spite of that most Group's functions overlap with Page's, we choose to use Page mainly because Page comes with an administrator that can post on Page's wall under the name of the Page. For example, on a Page called ``CMPT307'' the administrator can post under the user name ``CMPT307''. This ``authoritative voice'' facilitates the broadcasting of information in scenarios like conference and courses. Page supports posting text, photos, and videos, commenting on posts, organizing events, and many other customized functions. In our project, we focus on building a prototype supporting only textual post and comment.
	\begin{description}
		\item[User] \hfill \\
		a person who has an account on Facebook
		\item[Page Administrator] \hfill \\
		a special user who creates a Facebook Page
		\item[Page] \hfill \\
		a Facebook Page that has a wall for both administrator and users to post
		\item[Post] \hfill \\
		 a Status administrator or users post to the Page's wall
		\item[Comment] \hfill \\ 
		 a comment on the Status
	\end{description}
	\item[Facebook Graph API] \hfill \\ 
	Facebook provides Graph API to allow developers to read and write to Facebook. With Graph API, developers can query anything about a person or a Page on Facebook as long as they are authenticated through the OAuth protocol. They can post things (e.g. text, photos, videos) to a person's wall or a Page through the Graph API as well. Graph API provides a simple and consistent view of Facebook's social graph, uniformly representing objects (e.g., people, photos, events, and pages) and the connections between them (e.g., friendships, likes, and photo tags)\footnote{http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/}.
